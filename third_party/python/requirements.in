# We need to download a dev release of pytorch because pytorch 2.0.0 depends on
# triton 2.0.0, which in turn states a circular dependency on torch. In reality,
# this dependency is only for tests. triton 2.0.0.post1 has the correct
# set of dependencies, but since torch specified an exact version instead of a
# min version, this leads to a conflict. Grab this nightly version until 2.0.1
# is released.
